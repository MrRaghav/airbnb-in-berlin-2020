With its presence in more than 80000 cities across the globe, **Airbnb** and its app play a significant role in the field of tourism with an amalgamation of the latest technology. 

This project analyses the open data set collected from [insideairbnb.com](http://insideairbnb.com/) to understand those aspects which have not only affected the business of the popular hotels but also created a stir among the local property dealers and brokers. 

Among European cities, **Berlin** holds a special economic, tourism and historical position. This makes it a prime focus for Airbnb. Therefore, I have focussed on data of Berlin for the year **2020**. 

The **knowledge discovery database (KDD)** approach of datamining has been used in this project.
